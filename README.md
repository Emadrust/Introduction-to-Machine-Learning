# Introduction to Machine Learning
This repository contains my codes and solutions for homework and final project of Machine Learning course held at [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) by [Prof.  Sanaz Seyedin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vm-JpcgAAAAJ&hl=en) in Fall 2022.
## Overview
The project focuses on speech emotion recognition using a deep learning model. The aim is to classify speech data based on emotions and recognize them using a custom-built deep neural network.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eK8gcrjK8mZPl6BUYxrd06VyuQxWU4zE/view?usp=drive_link). After downloading, extract the files and place them in the appropriate directory for the project to run properly.
