# Introduction to Machine Learning
This repository contains my codes and solutions for homework and final project of Machine Learning course held at [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) by [Prof.  Sanaz Seyedin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vm-JpcgAAAAJ&hl=en) in Fall 2022.
## Overview
The project focuses on speech emotion recognition using a deep learning model. The aim is to classify speech data based on emotions and recognize them using a custom-built deep neural network.
## Dataset
The speech dataset used for this project is committed to the repository and can be accessed directly. It includes labeled speech data classified by emotion, which is used for training and evaluating the model.
